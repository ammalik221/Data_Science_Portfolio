# Deep Learning Projects
This Repository contains a portfolio of data science projects presented using Jupyter Notebooks. I have documented the projects for academic.

For a more visually pleasant experience, check out my portfolio at [ammalik221.github.io](https://ammalik221.github.io/ammar-portfolio/)

# Contents

- ### Deep Learning
  - [Dogs vs Cats Prediction Problem](): Designing and implementing a classifier which learns to differentiate between Dogs and Cats using image embeddings obtained from a pretrained network (VGG16).
  - [Finding nuclei in images](): A computer model that can identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions for Data Science Bowl 2018 hosted by Kaggle.
  - [Digit Recognizer](): Designing and implementing a CNN model that can identify digits by MNIST data.
  - [TGS Salt Identification Challenge](): Keras based Unet implementation with ResNet Encoder.
   
- ### Machine Learning
  - [Titanic Dataset](): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers on board RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
  - [Movie Recommender System](): A basic recommender system with Python and pandas.
  - [Stock Price Prediction](): Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
  - [Iris Dataset](): Classifying flowers based on different types of features using a Random Forest Generator.

- ### Personal Projects
  - [Bio-medical Image Segmentation](): A keras based implementation of UNet++ model used for image segmentation based on a [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10165) by Zhou et al.
  - [RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](): The algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.

  - [Data Analysis Techniques](): A Jupyter notebook containing data analysis techniques using Pandas and Seaborn library.
  - [Data Augmentation Techniques](): Different Image Augmentation techniques using a custom data generator.

- ### Natural language Processing
  - [Sentiment Classifier](): A simple classifier based on a public set of tweets labelled with various sentiments.
  - [Generating Shakespeare-Like Texts](): Using LSTMs to generate text based on the dataset provided by Project Gutenberg.
