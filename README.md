# Contents

- ### Deep Learning.([Here](https://github.com/ammalik221/Neural-Network-Projects))
  <!--- **Finding nuclei in images:** A computer model that can identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions for Data Science Bowl 2018 hosted by Kaggle.
  - **TGS Salt Identification Challenge:** Keras based Unet implementation with ResNet Encoder.
  - **Bio-medical Image Segmentation:** A comparision of U-Net and U-Net++ model by using them for [segmenting OCT images(DME)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chiu-2015).
  - **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge:** The algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.-->
  - **CS-231n:** Completed Assignment solutions for CS231n: [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html), provided by Stanford.
  - **Image Style Transfer:** Compose one image in the style of another image. This is and optimization technique which uses two images and blends them together, so that output image looks like one image in the style of the other image.
   
<!--- ### Machine Learning.([Here]())
  - **Titanic Dataset:** Exploratory Analysis of the passengers on board RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
  - **Movie Recommender System:** A basic recommender system with Python and pandas.
  - **Stock Price Prediction:** Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
  - **Iris Dataset:** Classifying flowers based on different types of features using a Random Forest Generator.-->

- ### Natural language Processing.([Here](https://github.com/ammalik221/Neural-Network-Projects))
  - **Sentiment Classifier:** Sentiment Analysis using LSTM on movie reviews which identifies whether the review is positive or not.
  - **Generating Shakespeare-Like Texts:** Using LSTMs to generate new text character by character imeplemented in PyTorch, based on Andrej Karpathy's [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) on RNNs
  
- ### Mini Projects.([Here](https://github.com/ammalik221/Mini-Projects))
  <!--- **Dogs vs Cats Prediction Problem:** Designing and implementing a classifier which learns to differentiate between Dogs and Cats using image embeddings obtained from a pretrained network (VGG16).
  - **Digit Recognizer:** Designing and implementing a CNN model that can identify digits by MNIST data.
  - **Generate new handwritten digits:** Using a Variational Autoencoder to generate new handwritten digits.
  - **Data Analysis Techniques:** A Jupyter notebook containing data analysis techniques using Pandas and Seaborn library.
  - **Data Augmentation Techniques:** Different Image Augmentation techniques using a custom data generator.-->
  - **Fashion-MNIST Classification:** Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples. Classifying them into classes using CNN's.
  - **PyTorch Warm-up:** Some basic pytorch exercises based on this [repository](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples#warm-up-numpy) by Justin Johnson.
