# Deep Learning Projects
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out my portfolio at [ammarmalik.com](https://ammalik221.github.io/ammar-portfolio/)

Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

# Contents

- ### Deep Learning
  - [Dogs vs Cats Prediction Problem](): Designing and implementing a classifier which learns to differentiate between Dogs and Cats from image embeddings obtained from a pretrained network (VGG16).
  - [Finding nuclei in images](): A computer model that can identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions for Data Science Bowl 2018 hosted by Kaggle.
  - [Digit Recognizer](): Designing and implementing a CNN model that can identify digits by MNIST data.
  - [TGS Salt Identification Challenge](): Keras based Unet implementation with ResNet Encoder.
   
- ### Machine Learning
  - [Titanic Dataset](): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
  - [Movie Recommender System](): A basic recommender system with Python and pandas. Movies will be suggested by similarity to other movies.
  - [Stock Price Prediction](): Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
  - [Iris Dataset](): Classifying flowers based upon diffferent types of feature using a Random Forest Generator.

- ### Personal Projects
  - [Bio-medical Image Segmentation](): A keras based implementation of UNet++ model used for image segmentation based on the [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10165) written by Zhou et al.
  - [RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](): The algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.
  - [Generate new handwritten digits](): Using a Variational Autoencoder to generate new handwritten digits.
  - [Data Analysis Techniques](): A jupyter notebook containing data analysis techniques using Pandas and Seaborn library.
  - [Data Augmentation Techniques](): Different Image Augmentation techniques using a custom data generator.

- ### Natural language Processing
  - [Sentiment Classifier](): A simple sentiment classifier based on a public set of tweets labelled with various sentiments.
  - [Generating Shakespeare-Like Texts](): Using LSTMs to generate text based on the dataset provided by Project Gutenberg.


**Tools:**  _scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, keras, Tensorflow_
